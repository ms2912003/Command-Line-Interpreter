We developed a basic Command Line Interpreter (CLI), similar to a Unix/Linux shell, that
supports the following features:
1. Command Execution:
The CLI should execute system commands like pwd, cd, ls, ls –a,
ls –r, mkdir, rmdir, touch, mv, rm, cat, >, >>, |
2. Internal Commands:
Implement internal commands such as:
o exit: To terminate the CLI.
o help: Displays available commands and their usage.
And we used JUnit for testing.
